# README.md

I'm trying to learn how to code HTML/CSS/Javascript and the like so I made this website. I just finished a philosophy degree and the philosophical brain damage is still fresh, so this website is about a philosophical topic that interests me: [dialetheism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/) (the idea that some sentences can be both true and false at the same time).

Dialetheism is a radical rejection of [classical logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/), opposing the standard and oppressive view that all contradictions are false. You can join the resistance movement against classical logic by visiting this website and annoying your family in friends with long-winded rants about the evils of hyper-consistency in our formal systems.

Check out the [official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/).
