      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Is <i>DT</i> true or false?</h1>
	    <h2 style="text-align: center;">(<em>DT</em>) This sentence is false.</h2>
	
	    <p>Here's the issue: if <i>DT</i> is <b>true</b> then it is true that it is <b>false</b>. And if <i>DT</i> is <b>false</b> then it is false that it is false, making it <b>true</b>. So if <i>DT</i> is false, then it is true. And if <i>DT</i> is false, then it is true. Here is an illustration of this issue, courtesy of the Star-Trek Enterprise:</p>

	    <p>This is quite the tricky dilemma. How do we deal with it? I will discuss the various options below.</p>

	    <h2>The options</h2>
	    <h3>1. Who cares?</h3>
	    <p>To dismiss all this as a trivial issue with no practical significance or value, and to carry on about one's day. (This is probably the most reasonable response.)</p>
			
	    <h3>2. <i>DT</i> is meaningless</h3>
	    <p>To say that <i>DT</i> is meaningless. It is like saying 'the concept of a cumulonimbus cloud is happily married to the colour green' (or something). In other words: it's just gibberish hidden behind a grammatically correct polish (so the argument goes). The problem with this view is that there's no obvious principled reason why <i>DT</i> should be meaningless. For example, it's clear that we can meaningfully talk about the truth of various sentences. For example, consider the following two sentences:</p>
	        <ol>
			<li>"The opening statement of his court testemony was a bold-face lie."</li>
			<li>"When you said 'Bob's puppy is cute' you were speaking the truth."</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both those sentences were meaningful, so sentences about the truth of other sentences can be meaningful. Self-referential sentences can also be meaningful. For example, consider these two sentences:</p>
		<ol start="3">
	            <li>"This sentence is written in English."</li>
		    <li>"This sentence has 22 letters."</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Both of those sentences are meaningful, so self referential sentences can be meaningful, too. So both sentences about the truth of other sentences, and self-referential sentences, are true in isolation. Why is it, then, that when we put these two things together (the truth of a sentence + self reference) suddely the sentence that results from that is not meaningful? Seems like a cop-out.</p> 
			   

	    <h3>3. There is a hole in <i>DT</i> and all its truth value is leaking out</h3>
	    <p>One option is to say that there is a so-called 'truth value gap' in <i>DT</i>, so that the sentence is neither true nor false (even if it is not meaningless). But this runs into the same issues as before: if sentences about the truth of sentences have no truth value gap, and self-referential sentences have no truth value gap, then why does a gap suddenly appear when you put these two things together? (Answer: it doesn't. Because this option is, like option 4, merely a cop-out for the weak willed who are too scared to face the truth.)</p>

	    <h3>4. <i>DT</i> is both true and false.</h3>
	    <p>This is the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain" target="_blank" noopener=rel>galaxy brain</a> response, and the only correct answer. Some sentences are both true and false, at the same time. This is hard for many people to stomach but that is only because they are not strong enough to face the truth. But those readers who can stomach reality are encouraped to read up on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/" target="_blank" nooperner=real>dialetheism</a> (systems of mathematical logic that tolerate true contradictions). Dialethism is even cooler than it is fun, and will make you a lot of friends if you discuss it at parties.</p>
