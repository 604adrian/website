	    <h1>Inconsistent mathematics</h2>
	    <p>Dialetheism belongs to a family of logical systems known as 'paraconsistent logics.' Paraconsistent logics are logics that tolerate contradictions; dialetheism is a paraconsistent logic that takes the further step in saying that some contradictions are true.</p.

	    <p>Since logic is often used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof">prove mathematical theorems</a>, paraconsistent logics have interesting implications for mathematics (perhaps we can say that 'inconsistent mathematics' is mathematics that tolerates contradictions, whereas 'dialethic mathematics' is mathematics that things that some inconsistent mathematical objects are just as real as e.g. a sphere or Pi or whatever). The implications of paraconsistent logics on mathematics are as follows. First, we can do away with <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zermelo-set-theory/">Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory</a> (the rumors are true: it is ad hoc) in favour of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory">nïave set theory</a> (if one wishes). A second (and more interesting) implication of paraconsistent logics is that they can be used to prove interesting things about so-called 'impossible' shapes, like this:</p>

	    <p>It is of course true that one is unlikely to trip on an impossible shape while walking down the street (whereas one <em>is</em> liable to trip on e.g. a cube while walking down the street). Does that mean that impossible shapes are mere fictions?</p>

	    <p>It does not. While it is of course true that impossible shapes are <em>physically</em> impossible, this does not necessarily mean that they are <em>mathematically</em> impossible. Because impossible objects could be similar to, for example, hyper-cubes (5 dimensional cubes). Hyper-cubes are of course not physically possible (at least not within classical physics), but they are obviously mathematically possible. According to dialethic mathematics, then, impossible shapes follow a similar pattern: the physical world precludes their realization, but their potential for realization lays latent within mathematics, so in principle they could have been realized had the world been different (maybe if Escher was God, for example).</p>

	    <p>Note that we cannot visualize 5D shapes but we <em>can</em> visualize impossible shapes. So if we are willling to say that physically impossible shapes that we cannot even visualize are legitimate mathematical objects, we should be willing to allow physically impossible shapes that we <em>can</em> visualize as legimate mathematical objects (especially when we have the tools to rigourously discuss these objects, and prove theorems about them, which is exactly what dialetheism gives us the tools to do in the case of the so-called 'impossible' shapes).</p>
